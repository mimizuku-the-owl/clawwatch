[ClawWatch](https://github.com/0xdsqr/clawwatch/tree/feat/tanstack-migration) is a local-first, self-hostable monitoring, alerting, and management system for your agentic agents. The tool provides out of the box support for:

- 💰 **Real-time cost monitoring** — track spend across models and agents as it happens
- 📊 **Token usage analytics** — input, output, cache read/write breakdowns with efficiency metrics
- 🤖 **Multi-agent management** — monitor all your agents from a single dashboard
- 🔔 **Smart alerting** — configurable alert rules with severity levels and auto-evaluation
- 📈 **Interactive charts** — cost over time, model comparison, token distribution
- 🗂️ **Session tracking** — drill into individual sessions, see cost per conversation
- 💸 **Budget controls** — set spending limits per agent or globally with projected monthly burn
- 📁 **File system access** — browse and edit agent workspace files directly from the dashboard
- ⚡ **Live event stream** — real-time feed of agent activity (messages, tool calls, errors)
- 🔄 **WebSocket collector** — connects to your gateway for live data ingestion + historical backfill
- 🌙 **Dark mode** — because obviously
- 🏠 **Fully self-hosted** — your data stays on your machine
